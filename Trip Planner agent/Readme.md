# Trip Planner Agent 
Trip Planning AI agent with the help of Phidata and open source llm models

**Note : You need to create [Phidata](https://www.phidata.com/) and [Groq](https://groq.com/) api keys for this agent. Please create your api key and create a .env file in your working environment and mention the api keys there.**


### ðŸ§¾ Description
The agent is able to provide proper itinerary with the proper mention dates. It is having 2 two agents, calculator and trip_planner. Both can be used simultaneously for the purpose. This agent I have accessed it on the phidata playground which provides a good UI for interacting with the agent.

### ðŸš€ Model Implemented 
Used Groq which provides fast AI inference in the cloud. There are multiple open source models which can be used.<br>
Model used : llama-3.1-70b-versatile<br>
**Note : If you are using Phidata, please mention the open source model you are using, otherwise phidata uses openai by default and it will throw an error. If you have the openai api key, then it is good to go.**
